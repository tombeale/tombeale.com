.synopsis
This job came through a design/multimedia firm and some of the 
artwork was done by their designer. I was responsible for converting
his artwork into the appropriate formats, as well as the overall 
design and coding of the site.  I designed the background, navigation
bars, header and some of the other graphics. I coded all of the HTML
and JavaScript using UltraEdit.
