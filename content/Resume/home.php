	<?sep("In a nutshell:")?>
		I began working on web sites in the mid-nineties when Mosaic was the browser of choice. 
		Since then I've done a lot of development in CGI, PHP and ASP. 
		Along the way I've picked up a lot of experience with XML and databases (SQL Server, Access, MySQL). 
		I've routinely set up Single Sign-Ons and intefaces with third-party providers. 
		I'm an avid programmer and love challenges and finding ways to streamline production. 
		My code is clean, efficient and reusable with a lot of thought on quality, security and maintainability. 
		I've programmed in over a dozen languages and have a talent for debugging existing code.

		My career originally began as an illustrator, using pen, ink and airbrush, 
		then made the move from manual to digital design in the mid 80's, gaining a high level of proficiency 
		in CorelDraw, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, QuarkXPress, etc. 
		At this time, programming and computers was a passionate hobby of mine, and the move to the web was a natural direction for me.
